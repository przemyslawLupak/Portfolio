                <h3>Programing</h3>
                <p>Generally, in web-developing area I principally use the following languages:<strong>
                    JavaScript, TypeScript, Html, CSS</strong> for front-end development; plus, for back-end
                    development and database design, I usually use <strong>Java and SQL.</strong>
                    In my collage (Opole university of technology), I also used<strong> C and objective C++</strong>, but I
                    have less experiences with programming in these two languages, I used them to do
                    my school projects mostly, but I really much willing to improving it in the near future. </p>

                <h3>Languages</h3>
                <p>The languages I can speak are <strong>Polish, English and German.</strong> I come from Poland,
                    Polish is my native language. (Is it any nice way to say this sentence?) I’m able to
                    communicate fluently in English, my English level has reached to B2, moreover, I
                    already had various experiences with speaking in English in different situations, not
                    only during my work but also studied aboard as an international exchange student to
                    Portugal previously. I had studied German long before, I still remember the basic
                    vocabulary and still be able to communicatie, however, the work I used to had in
                    Germany also helped me improve my German.</p>

                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>In current projects I mainly use <strong>Angular SpringBoot, mySQl, Bootstrap and Git</strong>. I
                    usually used Angular for dealing with Api&#39;s, some of them I created by myself by
                SpringBoot and mySQL, for mySQL, which is a tool I’m using to build a database.
                    Lastly, when pages layout is not too complicated, I’m using a bootstrap, after that, for
                    
                    managing my workflow, I&#39;m using a git tool embedded in visual studio code or pure
                    git bash.</p>
